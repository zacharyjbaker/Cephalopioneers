HOW TO EDIT CLARITY

1. Open "clarity.aseprite" in Aseprite or if you are using another software, open "clarity.png" in it (note that clarity.png does not have layers)
2. Edit or add glyphs using full black (#000000)
3. Save as "clarity.png"

If you only edited glyphs and didn't add new ones, skip steps 4 and 5

4. Open "Clarity Pixel Font Converter Settings.json"
5. Add new characters in exact the same spots in "in-glyphs" array as they are in "clarity.aseprite" and "clarity.png"
6. Open Pixel Font Converter (https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont/)
7. Select "Import" and open "Clarity Pixel Font Converter Settings.json"
8. Select "Pick image" and open "clarity.png"
9. Select "Save TTF"
10. If you need other file formats like OTF, you can use a font converter like https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-otf
